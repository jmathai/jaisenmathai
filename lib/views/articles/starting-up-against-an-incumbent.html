<h3>The incumbent</h3>
<p>
  An incumbent is someone who already holds an existing position. 
  For most (not many) social applications their incumbent if Facebook even if Facebook's not competing at the moment.
  We built a student collaboration platform similar to Blackboard and Moodle but one which didn't suck and was geared towards students.
  Talking to students reaffirmed that what we were building filled a need.
  We decided that the first place to launch it is where the student already were, Facebook.

<h3>An (un)competitor</h3>
<p>
  Fred Wilson blogged about <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/04/the-twitter-platform.html" target="_blank">not filling holes</a> back in April, 2010.
  It makes perfect sense...don't build something on top of someone else's platform that they should have built themselves.
  Why?
  Because they'll get around to building it.
  He uses Twitter as an example and uses desktop clients, search and photo sharing as services that filled holes.
</p>
<p>
  He's absolutely correct, in hindsight.
  If developers knew Twitter's roadmap included building a desktop client then I'm sure we'd see fewer available.
  His example of "social gaming" on Facebook's platform as a <em>new industry</em> doesn't really make a lot of sense to me.
  The only reason it's a <em>new industry</em> is because Facebook hasn't decided that it's a hole it wants to fill.
  Once it does, then the slew of gaming companies that rely on Facebook as a distribution channel become irrelevant.

  Chris Dixon had a pretty good <a href="http://cdixon.org/2010/01/26/incumbents/" target="_blank">post about incumbents</a> that helped me forumate my thoughts.
  It talks about both sides of the coin including what to do and not to do.
  The suggestions work best if you know someone that works at the incumbent's company but they're valuable nonetheless.

<h3>When you can't see the future</h3>
<p>
  We knew that Facebook was our biggest competitor even though they didn't have a good way for a group of people that aren't all friends to collaborate.
  The day they decided to do this, we knew they'd be our rival.
  We even included this in our executive summary under the <em>competition</em> section.
  Since we didn't know what their roadmap looked like we plowed forward and focused on gaining traction.
  In hindsight their acquisition of Hot Potato might have been writing on the wall for us...but maybe it wasn't - it's all conjecture.
</p>
<p>
  Last week Facebook announced an overhaul to their groups.
  They became our rival and we hadn't gained any significant traction yet.
  It didn't shock us but it was a pretty eye opening experience.
  About 6 months of work that included coding, going to college campuses and talking to students and begging professors to let us demo our product was on the verge of being a waste.
</p>
<p>
  Of course Facebook's overhaul of their groups made perfect sense.
  It also make perfect sense for them to get into social gaming.
  For the sake of companies that produce games for Facebook let's hope they don't.
</p>

<h3>The lure</h3>
<p>
  The lure of a social graph of 500 million users is temping is the understatement of the decade.
  It's a brilliant platform to launch (aside from the many bugs and crappy documentation), reach millions of users and grow virally.
  There are lots and lots of success stories that did just that.
</p>
<p>
  For me the lessons I learned are that the catch is much more important than the lure.
  I probably won't be building applications on top of Facebook's platform (or Twitter's for that matter).
  It's not that I don't believe there's potential, there's plenty.
  I've worked extensively with both and I think depending on 3rd party closed APIs is a step backwards.
  I justified the hassles of building on someone else's by focusing on the audience.
  In the end it's not worth it for me.
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of writing this is more for myself than anything else.
  It's cathartic.
  Don't take it as advice not to do what we did but let me know if you've had similar thoughts or experiences.
