<h3>EpiSuite / An unintrusive web framework</h3>
  
  <p>
    Frameworks are great.  
    However, they are generally large and bloated.  
    If you're a developer who likes structure but doesn't like to be left in the dark about what's going on under the hood then some or all of EpiSuite is for you.
    EpiSuite consists of a PHP framework for building web applications (both pages and services) and a client and server side form validation module.
    These two pieces are completely independant and can be used individually or together.

    <strong>EpiCode</strong> is a PHP framework with several goals.
    <ul>
      <li>Have as small a footprint as possible (currently around 100 lines of PHP)</li>
      <li>Be straightforward and easy to understand even for intermediate PHP developers</li>
      <li>Make it as fast as possible to build web pages and services</li>
    </ul>
    Additionally, EpiCode generates clean urls and makes it extremely easy to manage URIs.

  <p>
    <strong>EpiForm</strong> is a two part form validation module.
    You can perform client side validation, server side validation or both.  
    EpiForm has several goals.
    <ul>
      <li>Have easy syntax which can be easily added to new or existing fields</li>
      <li>Be flexible to allow for the diverse validation rules which need to be applied to an input field</li>
      <li>Let you define validation rules once and run those rules on both pre (client) and post (server) submission</li>
      <li>Display notifications for client side validation failures using CSS and/or Javascript</li>
      <li>Work with common Javascript libraries (currently only works with prototype.js - YUI support coming soon)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    EpiCode and EpiForm work great together.
    In fact, if you like using one then you'll like using the other.
    There's no dependency from one to the other so you can choose what flavor of EpiSuite you use.
    EpiSuite is fully open sourced and you can do with it as you wish.
