<h3>EpiSuite</h3>

<p>
  EpiSuite started out as a minimalist web framework (EpiCode).  
  I built it for use with Textbook Revolt and it helped us complete the site in 4 weeks.  
  EpiSuite has since been used for several other projects and has grown to include the following.
  <ul>
    <li>EpiCode - An exceptionally fast and easy to understand MVC framework.</li>
    <li>EpiDatabase - A database wrapper with catchable exception handling.</li>
    <li>EpiForm - A client and server side form validator which supports both Prototype.js and YUI.</li>
    <li>EpiCurl - An asynchronous HTTP library which uses curl.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Textbook Revolt</h3>

<p>
  Textbook Revolt is a <a href="http://www.textbookrevolt.com/" target="_blank">100% free college book exchange</a>.  
  The site uses Amazon's Search API which allows users to search by ISBN, title or author.  
  Facebook integration was successfully implemented using the Facebook Platform.
  A custom framework helped us complete the site in 4 weeks.
