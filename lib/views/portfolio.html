  <h3>EpiSuite</h3>
  
  <p>
    EpiSuite is a minimalist web framework.  
    I built it for use with Socialbib and it helped us complete the site within 4 weeks.  
    I've authored countless web sites, applications and services over the years.  
    They've all had the same thing in common...frameworks (or lack thereof) which almost made sense.
    EpiSuite represents the simplest way to retrieve a resource and send it to the user.  
    Resources are what people are searching for and can come in the form of web pages, search results or a PDF file.  
    EpiSuite aims to convert the traditional page per request mentality with a resource per request one.

  <h3>Socialbib.com</h3>
  
  <p>
    Socialbib is a <a href="http://www.socialbib.com/" target="_blank">100% free college book exchange</a>.  
    The site uses Amazon's Search API which allows users to search by ISBN, title or author.  
    Facebook integration was successfully implemented using the Facebook Platform.
    A custom framework helped us complete the site in 4 weeks.
