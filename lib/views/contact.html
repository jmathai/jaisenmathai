  If you're contacting me about a job then please ask yourself these quesions before contacting me.
  <ul>
    <li>Is it a really cool job opportunity with a really cool company?</li>
    <li>Do they serve free lattes or better yet free lunch?</li>
    <li>Does the number of engineers outnumber sales and marketing employees combined?</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  If you answered yes to all of the above questions then chances are I'd enjoy receiving an email from you.  My email address is <a href="mailto:jaisen@jmathai.com">jaisen@jmathai.com</a>.
