  I'm a Christian, <a href="http://photos.jaisenmathai.com/users/jmathai/photos/tags-tavin,favorites">father</a> and <a href="http://photos.jaisenmathai.com/users/jmathai/photos/tags-rachel,favorites">husband</a> (in order of importance).
  At the moment I live in <a href="http://photos.jaisenmathai.com/users/jmathai/photos/tags-sunnyvale,favorites">Sunnyvale, California</a> and work at <a href="http://photos.jaisenmathai.com/users/jmathai/photos/tags-yahoo">Yahoo!</a>.

  I was born in <a href="http://photos.jaisenmathai.com/users/jmathai/photos/tags-cincinnati,favorites">Cincinnati, Ohio</a> and moved out west in 2007 right after getting married.
  Back in 2005 I co-founded a photo sharing start-up.
  We raised a round of angel funding and stored over a million photos before finally shutting down the service.
  Since then I've been involved in several start-ups including a Twitter marketing service we sold for virtually nothing and a textbook rental site that's still chugging along today.

  Ultimately Rachel and I plan on moving somewhere (probably India) to help people that don't have easy access to things like food, clothing and shelter.
