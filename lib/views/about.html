  I'm a Christian, <a href="http://photos.jaisenmathai.com/photos/tags-tavin,favorites/list">father</a> and <a href="http://photos.jaisenmathai.com/photos/tags-rachel,favorites/list">husband</a>.
  At the moment I am bootstrapping an <strong><a href="http://theopenphotoproject.org">open source photo service named OpenPhoto</a></strong> and living in <a href="http://photos.jaisenmathai.com/photos/tags-sunnyvale,favorites/list">Sunnyvale, California</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I was born in <a href="http://photos.jaisenmathai.com/photos/tags-cincinnati,favorites/list">Cincinnati, Ohio</a> and moved out west in 2007 right after getting married.
  Back in 2005 I co-founded a photo sharing start-up.
  We raised a round of angel funding and stored over a million photos before finally shutting down the service.
  Since then I've had several side projects including a Twitter marketing service we sold for virtually nothing and a textbook rental site that's still chugging along today.

  Ultimately Rachel and I plan on moving somewhere (probably India) to help people that don't have easy access to things like food, clothing and shelter.
