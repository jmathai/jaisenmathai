  I'm currently living in Sunnyvale, CA and working at <img src="/images/yahoo_logo-a.gif" border="0" alt="Yahoo!" /> as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>.  
  Aside from work I spend a portion of my time developing software for various ideas I can't seem to keep from having.

  <h3>Textbook Revolt</h3>
  <p>
    I am currently focusing on building a <a href="http://www.textbookrevolt.com/" target="_blank">student to student textbook rental platform</a>.
    There are two others on the team and we're excited about solving the <em>overpriced textbook problem</em> once and for all.

  <h3>PubliciTweet</h3>
  <p>
    A recent site I created was <a href="http://publicitweet.com" target="_blank">Twitter marketing tool</a> named <a href="http://publicitweet.com" target="_blank">PubliciTweet</a>.
    As part of the project I wrote a library for the Twitter OAuth API in order to better understand the OAuth specification.
    That library is available on <a href="http://github.com/jmathai/twitter-async/tree/master" target="_blank">Github</a> as is the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/jmathai/twitter-async" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
    One of the biggest challenges of this project was to efficiently make tens of thousands of API calls while honoring Twitter's API limits.
  </p>
  <p>
    I ended up selling the site in order to focus on the <a href="http://www.textbookrevolt.com/" target="_blank">student to student textbook rental platform</a> mentioned above.  
    Before selling the site it had already sent <em>700,000</em> direct messages on Twitter and averaged over <em>40%</em> click throughs.

  <h3>Photagious</h3>
  <p>
    In 2003 I began working on my largest and most successful project, a photo sharing application named <a href="http://photos.jaisenmathai.com/users/jmathai" target="_blank">Photagious</a>.  
    We bootstrapped for 2 years and raised funding but ultimately had to shut the service down in 2009.
    I still run a version of the site for my personal use and utilize it's API to integrate my photos into the right bar.
