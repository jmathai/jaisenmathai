  I'm currently living in Sunnyvale, CA and working at <img src="/images/yahoo_logo-a.gif" border="0" alt="Yahoo!" /> as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>.  
  Aside from work I spend a portion of my time developing software for various ideas I can't seem to keep from having.

  <h3>PubliciTweet</h3>
  The latest project I am working on is a <a href="http://publicitweet.com" target="_blank">Twitter marketing tool</a> named <a href="http://publicitweet.com" target="_blank">PubliciTweet</a>.
  As part of the project I wrote a library for the Twitter OAuth API in order to better understand the OAuth specification.
  That library is available on <a href="http://github.com/jmathai/twitter-async/tree/master" target="_blank">Github</a> as is the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/jmathai/twitter-async" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
  One of the biggest challenges of this project was to efficiently make tens of thousands of API calls while honoring Twitter's API limits.

  <h3>Textbook Revolt</h3>
  In the summer of 2007 I began working on what we're calling a social experiment named <a href="http://www.textbookrevolt.com/" target="_blank">Textbook Revolt</a>.  
  In 4 weeks, a collegue of mine and I envisioned and created a book exchange platform for college students.  
  It's a pretty cool site and utilizes the Amazon Search API and ties into Facebook using the Facebook Platform.

  <h3>Photagious</h3>
  In 2003 I began working on my largest and most successful project, a photo sharing application named <a href="http://photos.jaisenmathai.com/users/jmathai" target="_blank">Photagious</a>.  
  We bootstrapped for 2 years and raised funding but ultimately had to shut the service down in 2009.
  I still run a version of the site for my personal use and utilize it's API to integrate my photos into the right bar.
