Infinity

a regeneration of which i wasn't aware.
my soul's been ripped from itself,
and taken residence elsewhere.
my existence resides no longer in me.
any purpose i have is with another.
the cavern measures to infinty,
it's filled with fear and despair.
and love.
mainly love.
you're clueless.
despite my attempts at bringing you to understanding.
you're two.
this is just the beginning of what feels like forever.
