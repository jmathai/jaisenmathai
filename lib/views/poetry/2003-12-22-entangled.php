Entangled

in your eyes
i see 20 years back
before the pain
sooner than the change
prior to your future being etched in stone
as you read your sentence
sadness
emptiness
failure
i question your translation
you've had a contrasting impact
through you i've seen
joy
fulfillment
motivation

yet i close my eyes and look away
i know the implications
but not how to respond
i sit mute
only able to listen
to stories of his hands and stories
in his departure your father fades away

as you lose ways to define yourself
you lose hope and gain confusion
the roadmap of your life dissolves

the weight of your head against mine
as i look over your shoulder
i see the horizon approaching
the water meets the sky
your eyelids fall
tears drip from your lashes
onto my skin

when you're ready you'll see the horizon
till then we remain...entangled
