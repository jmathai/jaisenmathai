Six Months and Counting

you weren't more than a minute
tucked away safe and secure
protected from the sting of this world
safeguarded and nurtured by love

you went as far as the east is from the west
through another's eyes you saw so much
i pray that i showed myself to you
through those eyes...your window to the world

i still remember staring at your picture
to see if i could see you looking at me to see me looking at you
i caught a glimpse
through your eyes and into your soul
where the sweetest most innocent fighter lived
your battles have left scars on me
they're my way of remembering you

i think of hours, days, and weeks
how long will this go on
what more needs to pass before i can see you again
from right now it's six months and counting
