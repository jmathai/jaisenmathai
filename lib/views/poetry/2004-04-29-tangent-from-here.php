Tangent From Here

to stop the pain i removed myself
from us and from you
i changed my ways from who i was
becoming who i thought you wanted
i didn't let you in on my plan
that would have hindered it's success

i look back at the implementation
see the flaws and the contradictions
realize even why it never would have worked
because that's never what you wanted
how was i to know?
i just wanted us to be happy

in that effort i've pulled us apart
to a state of confusion
not knowing us and not knowing each other
you were always in the center of it all
perhaps i should have shouted when i told you
the whisper after tapping you on the shoulder failed

to reinvent the wheel
what's next for us?
the spiral staircase of our love
going nowhere but here
will we find the tangent and follow that path?
