Pending Mistake

i sit here and dwell
on all that i said
opening wounds and breaking the skin
i lay here in my own mess
my choices and consequences
knowing that regret will catch up with me
that day when i think of you
when i will realize that i could have held on
but chose to let go?
looking in the mirror i can't understand
this person looking back at me
clueless and insecure
i turn away in disgust
couldn't the reflection be different?
couldn't the flaws be hidden?
wishing something else upon myself
i close the door and appologize to her
for nothing i can fix or help
but for all that i was and am
for that which i could have changed
or decided to do differently
when i looked in that mirror
i wish i saw you
looking back at me
but i turned away for that moment you were there
though i stare for it again
i know it's gone and in the past
