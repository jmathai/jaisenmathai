Sunday

our eyes met numerous times in my youth.
every sunday morning .
as i counted the ticks of the second hand.
i remember my eyelids feeling like lead.
the sting to keep them open.
i remember the times you went out of your way.
so our paths would cross.
you always had something to say.

it wasn't till many years later that our hearts met.
the confusion which set in.
the palpitation of fear.
the sudden peace.
it was all foreign to me.
life was simple.
simply filled with nothing.

you being with me changed my life.
changed me.
but still today...years later...i have doubts.
questions.
it's a battle between my heart and my mind.
they just argue sometimes.
there's noone around to make peace.

you know the struggles i have.
the uncertainties.
the skepticism.
the ambiguity strikes a nerve.

i ask myself if this is where i need to be.
with you.
i'll follow my heart always.
but i can't ignore my mind.
