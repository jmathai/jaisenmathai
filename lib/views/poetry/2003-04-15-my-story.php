My Story

my story.
my life.
from the past.
from the present.
even the future.
though it's unknown.

most of it's lost.
it's escaped my memory.
pictures here.
pictures there.
a picture is worth a thousand words.
but a memory can't be measured.

some parts are etched.
forever in my mind.
those fibers of the brain that don't change.

happiness, childhood, innocense.
sorrow, maturity, guilt.
it's all there.
it collectively paints the portrait i call "my story".

from anger and angst.
from sources i can't remember.
hate without reason.
well, without fair reason.
to hate a large group because of a few individuals.
bitterness grew out of hate.
until i was miserable.
out of miserableness grew a quest to find an answer.
out of hate grew tolerance.

enter first crush.
out of touch.
akwardness.
fear.
the inability to share myself.
due to not knowing myself.
the pain of an end.
an extreme period of sadness.
cause?
unknown.
perhaps rejection and failure.
a point of healing.
a new view of life.
a time of peace.

a god.
my God.
my life ... changed.
a new type of love.
unconditional love and acceptance.
grace and mercy.
an end to life with expectations.

then began a life changing relationship.
a first date.
a first dance.
a first kiss.
a first love.
a first betrayal.
a first loss.
a first relationship with a permanent impact.
an experience that taught me to love.
to know myself.
to see my flaws.
to know someone.
what that means is beyond the scope of words.
beyond the scope of anything.
the greatest thing i know.
loss.
the greatest pain i've felt.
the turbulence which which followed.
the repeated thoughts of life ending which seemed like only a dream.

the change.
the light.
the survival.
a new perspective.
a new life.
answers to prayers.
tranquillity.

the present.
the peace.
a new love for people and relationships.
love.
a continual search.
for what else i need to learn.
independence.
lonliness.
faith in God.
the desire to tread forward.

the future.
unknown.
confident.
in choices.
in life.
in me.
