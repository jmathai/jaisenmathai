Forward Momentum

like the cosmic wonders
or the natural disasters
some things aren't common

the facade of trust
and the appearance of loyalty
wither to nothing as illusions

such things are common
such things are easy

difficulty and pain lay in our path
as do determination and persistence
the years of ups
and the seemingly longer years of downs
wrench in our sides
together

we've been pierced
cut up
spit out
put back together and analyzed
not by others
by you
by me

but unlike the common elements of life
we strive forward
through all of this
looking back and not letting go
instead holding on

one day you'll know
we are beyond fickle
well past temperamental
you are an indistinguishable part of me
we can't get rid of the other
without first getting rid of ourselves
