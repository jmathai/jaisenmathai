Unwanted

your partial friendship
i don't want it
your waves of loyalty
which crash in as you deem necessary
keep it and share it with someone else
the timeliness of your kindness
and the flukes which surround them
are not coincinences at all
elements which ultimately benefit you
spark your interest in my existence

otherwise i am far from your mind
my condition and emotion are vapor to you
you wouldn't know how my day was
you wouldn't care either
i've come to accept that
now, if only i could get you to stop
calling
writing
pretending
to be my friend at times you need me
unseen any other time

until i devise a plan for that
i'll remain
patiently pretending
as you do the same
wasting the days away with useless chatter
with the presumption and outward appearance
that we are indeed...friends
