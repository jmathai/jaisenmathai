Make It Okay

if distance wasn't such a bitch
i could sit next to you and touch your head
take some of the pain and the warmth

i could tell you stories and make your eyes dance
take you by the hand and forget about being ill
i could see the smile return to your face

if just by being next to you...i can make your heart warm
i'm sure i could melt away the ice in many more ways than one

i'd reminisce of the times from years ago
when we were carefree and loving
the days of exploring each other
and the days of realizing the good and the bad

our past would make you smile
i'm sure of that
just one of those things you know in your core

you wouldn't feel so ill anymore
our minds would escape what we know to be today
they'd run rampant and only stop at our imagination

but as you rest...i dare not wake you
from peacefull slumber
i watch from a distance
