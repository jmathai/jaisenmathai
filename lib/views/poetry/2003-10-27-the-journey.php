The Journey

the disappearing tokens
of family and friends
riddle my mind
with thoughts of why

the disintegrating ashes
as friends leave
and communication slows
hellos and goodbyes
become precious and rare
and the possibility of a next time
become just that...a possibility

though friendships endure this
the inevitable impact can't be dismissed
on the contrary
it needs to be embraced
through impact comes change
for the better, for the worse
this lies in the hearts of two

the jouney won't end
but leads to a differnt path
arriving at the same destination
where memories will be shared
while tears will be shed
and laughter will come again

the history, all of it
the good and the bad
overflows into where we are now
and where we will be one day
together again, looking back
remembering now
remembering our journey
