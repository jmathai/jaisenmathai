Shades of Truth

all of these layers i have added
the complexities i have defined as me
the effort spent to construct my words
have been an attempt to spare myself
to spare you as well

i haven't accepted that this isn't reciprocal
something so real to me
that burns me to the core
i don't understand it completely
how i alone can be affected

i wonder if space or time will bring a change
my thoughts consume my energy
i lay limp at times unable to function
the thoughts of you
the repression i must practice

if i could tell you how it feels
that it's like rubbing a dull blade along my neck
until my blood stops flowing
that it's like drowning myself in lucid waters
only to escape for a moment

if you could feel for a moment
what i feel throughout the day
i fear nothing would change
that tomorrow i will write these exact words once more
this leads me into seclusion

i feel you know
i've spoken these words to you
in different order and with different tones
but the message may have gotten through
i feel it has but i still wonder

if there's any wisdom in hope
