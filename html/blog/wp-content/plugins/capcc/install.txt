Troubleshooting

If your captcha is not being shown, first turn on the default wordpress theme and try again.
If the image is still is not shown make sure PHP has GD with freetype installed. (Use phpinfo to figure this out)
If image still does not show then try using absolute path to font in plugin configuration.
